# Inline Pronouns

A small BetterDiscord plugin to see the pronoun roles of my colleagues in the MIT 2027 server
in text channels.

Based on mwittrien's ["Top Role Everywhere"](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/TopRoleEverywhere) plugin and under the same GPL-2.0 license.
